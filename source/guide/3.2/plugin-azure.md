The following are [node](reference-terminology.html#node) type definitions. Nodes describe cloud resources in your cloud infrastructure. For more information, see [nodes](reference-terminology.html#node).

### Common Properties

All cloud resource nodes have common properties:

**Properties**

* `Subscription_id` is the 32 digit subscription id you will get on creation of a Microsoft Azure account in the settings tab of the older manage.azure.com portal. The location where you will find the subscription id is marked in red in the screenshot below. Defaults to ‘’ (empty string).

   * East US 2
   * Japan East
   * Japan West
   * North Europe
   * South Central US
   * Southeast Asia
   * West Europe
   * West US
*	`vm_name` this can be the name of the virtual machine created. The name of other resources required to create the virtual machine like resource group, storage account, virtual network, etc. will be derived from the vm_name string. Defaults to ‘my_vm’.
*	`client_id` the location where you will find the client id in azure account on the manage.azure.com portal is marked in red in the screenshot below. Defaults to ‘’ (empty string). <br/>
